            Prior to this assignment, I had little to no experience in CSS or HTML. Of course I had heard
            of both of these languages, but I had never used them myself. After working through this assignment, I had a greater
            knowledge of how to use these languages effectively and hope to expand upon this knowledge in the future. I'm not sure
            what techniques you would consider advanced, but I used different positioning like floating, relative, and static to get experience working with them
            and get elements exactly where I wanted them on the page. I really liked being able to style and design my own website and it was
            satisfying when it worked, however it was a bit frustrating trying to figure out what little thing was causing an element to be
            out of place, what was causing an image not to load, etc... The website I imagined looked better in my head but I'm still proud of the outcome.
